# Research

Welcome to my graduate thesis. In this thesis,a Elo based rating system is proposed that quantifies the strength of the basketball players.The contents of this projects can be divided as follows:
1) Datasets
    - Synthetic Datasets
    - Real world dataset(NBA season 2015-2017)
2) Screen scrapping code to generate the real world dataset.
    - Done using the python package selenium
3) The standard Elo rating system for predicting Wins/Losses 
4) The proposed Elo-based system to model players and predict Wins/Losses
5) A statistical framework to compare the standard and proposed algorithm
    - dataset is broken into train, validation, test set 
    - misclassification rate is computed
    - March Madness bracket is created and the bracket is assigned a score.
